      "Since the areas to the left and right of the central grey region are each doubled (from the two adjacent triangles), their sum must be \\(2 \\times (11 + 14) = 58\\), but this double-counts the central region, so the actual sum is the same as above: \\(11 + 14 + P = 11 + 14 + 46 = 69\\), so the previous calculation is incorrect; instead, the central grey region intersects each pairwise triangle exactly once, and the sums above and below the central region (as in the original triangle diagrams) must both be 9, so the previous sum was too low.\n\nLet's correct: The area to the right of the grey region is the combined area above the rightmost triangle and lower right triangle, which is \\(5 + (4 + 8) = 19\\), and the area to the left (i.e., the rightmost lower triangle) is \\(4\\), so the sum is \\(19 + 4 = 23\\). The leftmost triangle is next to the left of the central region, and the rightmost triangle is next to the right of the central region. The only remaining triangle is the one directly below P, which has area 2.\n\nThe central region intersects the leftmost triangle, rightmost triangle, and the rightmost lower triangle once each, so the sum of their areas, from this arrangement, gives the area of the central grey region: \\(2 + 4 + 9 = 17\\), and with the rightmost triangle (\\(5\\)), the remaining area is \\(P = 17 + 5 = 22\\), but since the region is cut into 4 triangles, the sum from the two adjacent left and right triangles is \\(2 + 4 = 6\\), and the central region must be split 1/4 along each diagonal.\n\nLet\u2019s recalculate: The area to the left of P, for example, consists of 3, 2, 9, and the rightmost triangle has area 5; so the sum is \\(3 + 2 + 9 + 5 = 23\\), and the remaining area is the area inside the rightmost triangle, which is 4. The leftmost triangle, in this case, has area 8 and the rightmost lower triangle has area 8, so the sum is \\(8 + 4 = 12\\).\n\nNow we have the total area left: \\(2 + 4 + 9 = 17\\), right: \\(5 + (4+8) = 19\\), and left: \\(2+4+8=12\\). The only missing triangle is directly below P, which has area 2.\n\nAdding the areas of the adjacent triangles around P and summing their combined area gives the area \\(P\\). The four triangles above and below P sum to \\(2+4+8+2=16\\), but P is bounded by the four triangles above and below it, and each of these four triangles has area 2, so \\(P = 8\\).\n\nThe previous reasoning was incorrect; instead, with the actual arrangement\u2014each segment and intersection is subdivided, but the areas are \\(2 + 4 + 9 = 16\\), \\(5 + 4 + 8 = 19\\), \\(2 + 4 + 8 = 12\\), and \\(P = 8\\) at the very least, so the initial interpretation must be more than one segment, as the central region is part of a wavy, bent \"ring\" around P.\n\nBut if we go to the center, the total area is the sum of all the regions, so the area \\(P\\) is the sum between areas \\(2+4+9\\), \\(5+4+8\\), \\(2+4+8\\), and the three rightmost regions, which are each divided into three sections, so the total area \\(P = (2+4+9) + (5+4+8) + (2+4+8) + (7+4)\\).\n\nLet\u2019s sum:\n- Leftmost of center: \\(2\\) to left of P, and rightmost of center: \\(8\\) to right of P.\n- Next to left: \\(4\\) to right of P, and rightmost of center: \\(7\\) to right of P.\n- Top of center: \\(9\\) to left side of P.\n- Bottom of center: \\(2\\) to right side of P.\n\nHowever this does not sum to exactly \\(17+19+12=46\\), so let\u2019s count the \"holes\": there are 4 small \"holes\" at the corners, and P is surrounded by 3 of these, but the wavy center region is not the full 3 segments, but rather the four small segments at the four corners, so the total area is",
      "Since the five triangles around P are split into 3 segments each, and each small \u201chole\u201d at the corners is subdivided, the region inside P should be one-third of each \u201chole\u201d divided by 4, because the five triangles are each one-third of the area inside P.",
