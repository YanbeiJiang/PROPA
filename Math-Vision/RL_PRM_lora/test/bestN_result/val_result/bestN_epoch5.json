Notice the angle at C in triangle BCA is 75\u00b0, thus point M is the midpoint of AB and the geometry contains 75\u00b0 angles. \n\nNow note that angle BMC = 75\u00b0. \n\nThe final answer is $90^{\\circ}$.\n\nRe-express the correct steps as follows: In a right triangle with angle B = 60\u00b0, the hypotenuse AB = 2x, and the length BC = x\u221a3. The midpoint M divides AB in half, making AM = MB = x/2, but in this triangle configuration, the angle at C MB subtended is 75\u00b0 from the right angle at B. So, angle BMC = 75\u00b0. \n\nHowever, for the triangle with angle B = 75\u00b0 at C, angle BMA = 75\u00b0 and angle BMC = 75\u00b0, so BMC must be 75\u00b0 + 15\u00b0 = 90\u00b0, but this is not one of the options.\n\nNow, because the triangle is right angled at B, and the angle B is 60\u00b0 (not 75\u00b0), let's re-express the correct angles: \n\nIn right triangle with angle B = 60\u00b0, angle A = 30\u00b0, so angle C = 60\u00b0 + 30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0. \n\nSo, B = x, MC = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), y = x\u221a3, M = (x\u221a3)/2, and so angle BMC = 75\u00b0 in triangle BMC with BC = x\u221a3.\n\nNotice the options and triangle relationships: If angle DBC is 30\u00b0 and angle CBD is 75\u00b0, then angle BMC = 75\u00b0, but this is not possible, so there should be a 90\u00b0 configuration given angle B = 30\u00b0 and DMC = 15\u00b0.\n\nIn right triangle CBA with angle DBC = 30\u00b0, angle CBA = 60\u00b0, thus angle DCA = 90\u00b0, and angle B = 30\u00b0, which does not match any configuration.\n\nSince the correct configuration is that the 30\u00b0 triangle at C, angle DMC = 15\u00b0, so BMC = 75\u00b0.\n\nGiven the triangle is right angled and with DBC = 30\u00b0 from RCP, B = x, D = (x\u221a3)/2.\n\n Thus, angle BMC = 75\u00b0, which is consistent and matches the earlier steps.\n\nIf the triangle has been slightly mis-structured, and the possible answers are 90\u00b0, 105\u00b0, 110\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 125\u00b0, the correct one, given the configuration, is 105\u00b0, as the sum with C = 30\u00b0 is 135\u00b0, and the third angle 75\u00b0 + 75\u00b0 = 150\u00b0 (which is not possible), thus the correct configuration is 106\u00b0, which is a possible difference: \"Let's revise the angle distribution and consider another approach\".\n\nAnother suitable configuration is that the triangle is right-angled at B, and the length AB = 8, so the midpoint M is at 2 units from A on AB, and angle DMC is 15\u00b0, so angle BMC = 105\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, the configuration can be described as there are three equal triangles, and the sum of angles at C (which is 30\u00b0) and B (which is 75\u00b0) is 105\u00b0, and at A is 60\u00b0.\n\nBut the earlier mentioned geometric construction is 75\u00b0; the correct answer given the diagram is 96\u00b0, since the only possible configuration with the 75\u00b0 angle at C and the"

Angle at C in triangle BCA is 75\u00b0 because angle B and MC are vertically opposite: \nSo, angle BMC = 180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 (since angle B is 60\u00b0)\n= 75\u00b0.\n\nThere must be a calculation error, so check the correct relation of the triangle.\n\n2.
